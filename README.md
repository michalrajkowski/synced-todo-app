# About
**This app is currently work in progress and not all features are implemented**

Knowledge bank + todo app that can be synchronized between multiple devices



# How to set it up
## Set up the synced-folder
You need to sync the `synced_data/` between several devices. I suggest using the [sync-thing](https://syncthing.net) app for that.
